# The system will look for this config file, first using
# a System property specified at startup:
#
# >java -Djava.util.logging.config.file=myLoggingConfigFilePath
#
# If this property is not specified, then the config file is
# retrieved from its default location at:
#
# JDK_HOME/jre/lib/logging.properties

# Global logging properties.
# ------------------------------------------
# The set of handlers to be loaded upon startup.
# Comma-separated list of class names.
# (? LogManager docs say no comma here, but JDK example has comma.)
handlers=java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler

# Loggers
# ------------------------------------------
# Loggers are usually attached to packages.
# Here, the level for each package is specified.
# The global level is used by default, so levels
# specified here simply act as an override.
