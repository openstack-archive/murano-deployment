# The point of this script is to update the list of contributor license
# agreements Gerrit knows about. More specifically, in its current form,
# it's being used by Puppet to perform database-specific parts of a
# migration for OpenStack's development and production Gerrit servers
# from Echosign to a Gerrit-managed CLA. As such, a lot of this code can
# be ripped out once that migration is complete (though it doesn't
# necessarily need to be, and can be left in place more or less
# indefinitely without impact).

# This function takes a contributor agreement ID and returns 0 if Y
# (active), 1 if N (inactive) or anything else (including if the CLA
# does not exist). It would be nice to implement this by short name
# instead, but Gerrit does not create the id column with auto_increment
# so we have to know what ID integers we want when creating anyway.
