# Start the Zabbix proxy from the init.d script?
# (Possible values: "yes" or "no")
#
# This is by default set to "no" because a MySQL database needs to be prepared
# and configured before you can start the Zabbix proxy for the first time.
#
# Instructions on how to set up the database can be found in
# /usr/share/doc/zabbix-proxy-mysql/README.Debian
