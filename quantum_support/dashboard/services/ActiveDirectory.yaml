            Windows requires strong password for service administration.
            Your password should have at least one letter in each
            register, a number and a special character. Password length should be
            a minimum of 7 characters.

            Once you forget your password you won't be able to
            operate  the service until recovery password would be entered. So it's
            better for Recovery and Administrator password to be different.
