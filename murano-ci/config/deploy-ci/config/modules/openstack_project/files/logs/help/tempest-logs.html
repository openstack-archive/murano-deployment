<h1>Guide to Devstack Gate Logs</h1>
<p>
  Above is a collection of log files from
  the <a href="../console.html">current tempest run</a>. Within them
  should be everything you need to get to the bottom of a test
  failure. The screen-* logs will be your most valuable tools in this
  process. Use the timestamp of a the failed test in
  the <a href="../console.html">current tempest run</a>.

<h2>Nova Compute Fails</h2>
<p>
  If there is a compute test failure, especially a server not getting
  created correctly, or being in an unexpected state, the following is
  typically the most fruitful order to look at things:
<ul>
  <li><a href="screen-n-api.txt.gz">screen-n-api.txt.gz</a> - the nova
    api log, which will show top level failures. Make sure the request
    that was being sent in actually suceeded.
  <li><a href="screen-n-cpu.txt.gz">screen-n-cpu.txt.gz</a> - the nova
    compute log. If a libvirt or qemu issue happened during guest
    creation it will be here.
  <li><a href="screen-n-sch.txt.gz">screen-n-sch.txt.gz</a> - the nova
    scheduler. Some times there are races in allocating resources, and
    the scheduler will throw a WARNING if it couldn't allocate the
    requested resources.
  <li>all other nova logs
</ul>
<h2>Cinder Volume Fails</h2>
<p>
  If there is a volume failure in the test, the following is typically
  the most fruitful order to look at things:
  <ul>
    <li><a href="screen-c-api.txt.gz">screen-c-api.txt.gz</a> - the
      cinder api log, which will show top level failures. Make sure
      the request that was being sent in actually suceeded.
    <li><a href="screen-c-vol.txt.gz">screen-c-vol.txt.gz</a> - the
      cinder agent log. If there was a local allocation error it will be
      here.
    <li><a href="screen-c-sch.txt.gz">screen-c-sch.txt.gz</a> - the
      cinder scheduler. Some times there are races in allocating
      resources, and the scheduler will throw a WARNING if it couldn't
      allocate the requested resources.
  </ul>
