This module holds classes that represent concepts in nodepool's
allocation algorithm.

The algorithm is:

  Setup:

  * Establish the node providers with their current available
    capacity.
  * Establish requests that are to be made of each provider for a
    certain label.
  * Indicate which providers can supply nodes of that label.
  * Indicate to which targets nodes of a certain label from a certain
    provider may be distributed (and the weight that should be
    given to each target when distributing).

  Run:

  * For each label, set the requested number of nodes from each
    provider to be proportional to that providers overall capacity.

  * Define the 'priority' of a request as the number of requests for
    the same label from other providers.

  * For each provider, sort the requests by the priority.  This puts
    requests that can be serviced by the fewest providers first.

  * Grant each such request in proportion to that requests portion of
    the total amount requested by requests of the same priority.

  * The nodes allocated by a grant are then distributed to the targets
    which are associated with the provider and label, in proportion to
    that target's portion of the sum of the weights of each target for
    that label.
