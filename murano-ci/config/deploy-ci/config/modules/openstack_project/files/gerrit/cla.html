<p><em>
In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with
Contributions from any person or entity, the OpenStack Project (the "Project")
must have a Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement") on file that has been
signed by each Contributor, indicating agreement to the license terms below.
This license is for your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection
of OpenStack Foundation as Project manager (the "Project Manager") and the
Project users; it does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for
any other purpose.
</em></p>

<p><em>
You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your present and
future Contributions submitted to the Project Manager. In return, the Project
Manager shall not use Your Contributions in a way that is contrary to the
public benefit or inconsistent with its nonprofit status and bylaws in effect
at the time of the Contribution. Except for the license granted herein to the
Project Manager and recipients of software distributed by the Project Manager,
You reserve all right, title, and interest in and to Your Contributions.
</em></p>

<li><p><strong>
Definitions.
</strong>
"You" (or "Your") shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by
the copyright owner that is making this Agreement with the Project Manager. For
legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other entities that
control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are
considered to be a single Contributor. For the purposes of this definition,
"control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or
management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership
of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial
ownership of such entity. "Contribution" shall mean any original work of
authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that
is intentionally submitted by You to the Project Manager for inclusion in, or
documentation of, any of the projects owned or managed by the Project Manager
(the "Work"). For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of
electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Project Manager or its
representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic
mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are
managed by, or on behalf of, the Project Manager for the purpose of discussing
and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked
or otherwise designated in writing by You as "Not a Contribution."
</p></li>

<li><p><strong>
Grant of Copyright License.
</strong>
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to the
Project Manager and to recipients of software distributed by the Project
Manager a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of,
publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your
Contributions and such derivative works.
</p></li>

<li><p><strong>
Grant of Patent License.
</strong>
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to the
Project Manager and to recipients of software distributed by the Project
Manager a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have
made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where
such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are
necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your
Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If
any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that Your
Contribution, or the Work to which You have contributed, constitutes direct or
contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that
entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of
the date such litigation is filed.
</p></li>

<li><p>
You represent that you are legally entitled to grant the above license. If your
employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that you create that includes
your Contributions, You represent that you have received permission to make
Contributions on behalf of that employer, that your employer has waived such
rights for your Contributions to the Project Manager, or that your employer has
executed a separate Corporate Contributor License Agreement with the Project
Manager.
</p></li>

<li><p>
You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original creation (see
Section 7 for submissions on behalf of others). You represent that Your
Contribution submissions include complete details of any third-party license or
other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents and
trademarks) of which you are personally aware and which are associated with any
part of Your Contributions.
</p></li>

<li><p>
You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except to the
extent You desire to provide support. You may provide support for free, for a
fee, or not at all. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing,
You provide Your Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR
CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without
limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NONINFRINGEMENT,
MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation, You may
submit it to the Project Manager separately from any Contribution, identifying
the complete details of its source and of any license or other restriction
(including, but not limited to, related patents, trademarks, and license
agreements) of which you are personally aware, and conspicuously marking the
work as "Submitted on behalf of a third-party: [named here]".
</p></li>

<li><p>
You agree to notify the Project Manager of any facts or circumstances of which
you become aware that would make these representations inaccurate in any
respect.
</p></li>

<li><p>
In addition, if you have provided a Contribution (as defined in the LLC
Contribution License Agreement below) to the Project under the Contribution
License Agreement to OpenStack, LLC ("LLC Contribution Agreement"), you agree
that OpenStack, LLC may assign the LLC Contribution Agreement along with all
its rights and obligations under the LLC Contribution License Agreement to the
Project Manager.
