# MS Windows image builder for OpenStack Murano

### Introduction

This repository contains MS Windows templates, powershell scripts and bash scripted logic that could used to create qcow2 images for QEMU/KVM based virtual machines used in OpenStack.

### MS Windows Versions
Supported by builder versions with en_US localization:
* Windows 2012 R2
* Windows 2012 R2 Core
* Windows 2008 R2
* Windows 2008 R2 Core

### Getting Started

Trial versions of Windows 2008 R2 / 2012 R2 used by default. You could use these images for 180 days without activation. You could download evaluation versions from official Microsoft website:
* [Windows 2012 R2 - download](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=11093)
* [Windows 2008 R2 - download](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-2012-r2)

##### System requirements
* Debian based Linux distribution, like Ubuntu, Mint and so on.
* Packages required:
 `qemu-kvm virt-manager virt-goodies virtinst bridge-utils libvirt-bin uuid-runtime samba samba-common cifs-utils`
* User should be able to run sudo without password prompt!
```
sudo echo "${USER}    ALL = NOPASSWD: ALL" > /etc/sudoers.d/${USER}
sudo chmod 440 /etc/sudoers.d/${USER}
```
* Free disk space > 50G on partition where script will spawn virtual machines because of `40G` required by virtual machine HDD image.
* Internet connectivity.
* Samba shared resource.

##### Configuring builder
Configuration parameters to tweak:

`[default]`
* `workdir` - place where script would prepare all software required by build scenarios. By `default` is not set, i.e. script directory would used as root of working space.
* `vmsworkdir` - must contain valid path, this parameter tells script where it should spawn virtual machines.
* `runparallel` - *true* of *false*, **false** set by default. This parameter describes how to start virtual machines, one by one or in launch them in background.

`[samba]`
* `mode` - *local* or *remote*. In local mode script would try to install and configure Samba server locally. If set to remote, you should also provide information about connection.
* `host` - in local mode - is 192.168.122.1, otherwise set proper ip address.
* `user` - set to **guest** by default in case of guest rw access.
* `domain` - Samba server user domain, if not set `host` value used.
* `password` - Samba server user password.
* `image-builder-share` - Samba server remote directory.

MS Windows install preparation:

`[win2k12r2]` or `[win2k8r2]` - shortcuts for 2012 R2 and 2008 R2.
* `enabled` - *true* of *false*, include or exclude release processing by script.
* `editions` - standard, core or both(space used as delimiter).
* `iso` - local path to iso file

By default `[win2k8r2]` - disabled, if you need you can enable this release in *config.ini* file.

### Run
#### Before run
* Run chmod +x "\*.sh" in builder directory to make script files executable.

#### Command line parameters:
`runme.sh` - main script
* `--help` - shows usage
* `--forceinstall-dependencies` - Runs dependencies install.
* `--check-smb` - Run checks or configuration of Samba server.
* `--download-requirements` - Download all required and configures software except MS Windows ISO.
* `--show-configured` - Shows configured and available to use MS Windows releases.
* `--run` - normal run
###### experimental options:
* `--config-file` - Reset configuration file location instead of default.

### Use cases
All examples below describes changes in `config.ini` file
1. I want to build one image for specific version and edition. For example: version - **2012 R2** and edition - **standard**. Steps to reach the goal:
 - Disable `[win2k8r2]` from script processing.
 ```ini
 [win2k8r2]
 enabled=false
 ```
 - Update `[win2k12r2]` with desired edition(**standard**).
 ```ini
 [win2k12r2]
 enabled=true
 editions=standard
  ```
 - Execute `runme.sh --run`
2. I want to build two images for specific version with all supported by script editions. For example: **2012 R2** and editions - **standard** and **core**. Steps to reach the goal:
 - Disable `[win2k8r2]` from script processing.
```ini
 [win2k8r2]
 enabled=false
 ```
 - Update `[win2k12r2]` with desired editions(**standard** and **core**).
 ```ini
 [win2k12r2]
 enabled=true
 editions=standard core
 ```
 - Execute `runme.sh --run`
3. I want to build two images for all supported by script versions with specific editions. For example: versions - **2012 R2** and **2008 R2** and edition - **core**. Steps to reach the goal:
 - Update `[win2k8r2]` with desired edition(**core**).
 ```ini
 [win2k8r2]
 enabled=true
 editions=core
 ```
  - Update `[win2k12r2]` with desired edition(**core**).
 ```ini
 [win2k12r2]
 enabled=true
 editions=core
 ```
 - Execute `runme.sh --run`
